## Notes

- Downloaded entry closes match the verified exchange closes (median ratio 1.0000); the series is on the exchange scale and no rescaling was applied.
- Prices fetched with auto_adjust=False (no dividend adjustment), which is what a capture study needs.
- No fees, slippage or taxes are modelled.
- Event 2018: Downloaded prices around this event sit on a different scale than the verified exchange closes (ratio 0.4115); that segment of the provider series appears split-adjusted and/or stale, so this row's captures are not reliable.
